# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

<!-- BEGIN PRODUCTOS -->
## This repo runs on ProductOS

- The product strategy system lives in `productos/` — checklists, templates, and skills. The strategy docs are the source of intent; don't guess at product decisions the docs already answer.
- The programme plan is `docs/PLAN.md`, when present (adopted at setup by `studio-setup`) — consult it before starting any phase work.
- The canonical product documents live in `docs/` at the repo root (`PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LAUNCHES.md`, `SECURITY-AUDIT.md`, …). ProductOS skills write them; they may sit alongside the repo's own docs.
- Build-loop plan files are `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/REFACTOR.md` — never `docs/PLAN.md` (the programme plan, no checkboxes) and never `productos/*-CHECKLIST.md`.
- Full system orientation: `productos/AGENTS.md`.
